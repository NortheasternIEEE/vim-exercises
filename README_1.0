Hello!

I assume you have opened me in VIM. Cool! 

Now hold on a sec, you cannot just start typing. Your in what is called command
mode.

Try moving your cursor here > <. While in command mode you can navigate with
the arrows, or with the keys 'h'(left), 'j'(down), 'k'(up), and 'l'(right). This
is so that a VIM user can always keep his fingers on the keyboard ready to type.

Now that you've mastered that, try to complete th . You can type text by
entering insert mode. That is done by pressing the 'i' key, makes sense. This
allows you to insert text before your cursor location in command mode. To exit
insert mode press 'Esc' or '^[' (meaning 'Ctrl-[').

There are multiple ways to enter insert mode however. Try pressing key 'a' from
command mode. Tell me why it's the 'a' key for 10.5 arbitrary awesome points.
Now try 'A' and 'I'.

Ok, now try '3dh', 'dd', and '5dd'. Opps, if you need some stuff back you can
always use 'u'.

Now try 'v', move your cursor a bit and then 'd'.

I wonder what 's' does?

What about 'V' and '^v'?

'gg'? 'G'? '^'? (actually just the '^' key) '$'?

Cool, so you can play with this all day when you get home. Lets try to come back
together to go over some more basic navigation and file-system stuff.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ok so, I am going to give you some things to do. Open a new terminal so you can
continue to read me.

Move to my directory. Make a new directory workspace.

Don't move. Make a new directory in workspace called work.

Move to work. Make a new directory in my origional directory called playspace.

Copy me to playspace.

Rename me in playspace to nonsense.

Delete this nonsense.

Go into work. Make three files named whynot1 whynot2 and whynot3.

Delete them all at once.

Delete workspace and playspace.

Ok, now get ready for some nifty utility commands.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ok sweet, you can grep like a boss now right? And by the way do you know why it
is called grep? Ofcourse, I just told you. Well try that out will you? Search
for all lines with Cool in them.

Open a new terminal again so you can continue to read.

How many times do I say I? Use grep from bash.

How many times do I say not?

How many times do I follow not with a single numerical digit?

What does -r do?

--color, thats cool.

-n? Nifty.

How many times do I follow not with any number of numerical digits? not344579.

How many words are there in this file?

How many lines are there in this file?

Ok, so what does --help do?

Oh now I've given it away. Everything is just going to be too easy now :(. Well,
maybe not ...

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How many empty lines are there in this file?

Think your too good for me now? How many times is grep mentioned in the grep man
page? Not the number of lines ..., the number of instances printed.

Read a man page with less.

Print all the lines containing words with two consecutive 'o's in them to a new
file.

Figure out how ever you can how to print the percentage of the data in your
documents directory modified this month.

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA. Hint, if you want to look into this, look at du, awk, and
date.

Well I think we're done for now. Thanks. Please e-mail wilkening.mark@gmail.com
with any feedback you may have about this session. The lecture style is a bit
experimental and I would enjoy knowing what you thought of it. Even if it is as
simple as a boooooooooooo or nice job, just shoot me a quick e-mail.
